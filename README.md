# Breakout

This is an environment emulating the Atari game *Breakout*. The goal is to break all the bricks in the wall without letting the ball touch the floor. You have 5 lives and get points more points for higher brick than for the lower ones.

See full description [here](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/atari/breakout/).

The observation is an image with dimensions (210, 160, 3).

There are 4 actions defined as NOOP, FIRE, LEFT and RIGHT.

In this project we implemented a Deep Q-Network agent, for the Atari game Breakout.

### Here is a preview of the game
